# Etch-a-sketch

In this project, i created something that looks like a sketch pad,
where you have the options to sketch in random colors or the option to sketch in black. 
I came to understand some keywords better like :focus much better.
I made use of javascript a lot in this project which helped me greatly in understanding, functions, variables and DOM in general.
Go ahead and enjoy this awesome sketch-like toy.
